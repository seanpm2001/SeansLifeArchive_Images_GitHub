### [Goal] Content fixes in Seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_GitHub

# V4 - 2022 Wednesday, March 30th

This is a log of content fixes I have been documenting for this project. Cleanup tasks are a bit excessive, as I have to delete dozens of files one at a time (unless there is a better way I don't know of) missing content tasks require re-uploads, but I don't have all the data on me right now for everything. These tasks are being held off to a future date.
