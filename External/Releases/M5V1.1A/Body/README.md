# Milestone 5 version 1.1B - 2022 January 27th

## M5V1.1B

### About

This is the third public release of my GitHub image folder for the SeanPM Life Archive project. This release contains all data from 2021 up to December 31st 2021.

This release is coming nearly a month late. I fell behind severely, and didn't get caught up until recently. The next release is going to take time, as I have to delete over a thousand `IGNORE.md` files. My original estimate is that it would take 22 or more days.

This is the final set of releases with new content. Continued updates will be in yearly repositories. To continue, go to: [https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_GitHub_Y2022](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_GitHub_Y2022)
