# Milestone 5 version 1.1B - 2022 April 28th

## M5V1.1B

### About

This is the fourth public release of my GitHub image folder for the SeanPM Life Archive project. This release contains all data from 2021 up to December 31st 2021.

The 22 day estimate for this release was really off. I couldn't continue the task consecutively, and it ended up taking nearly 4 solid months, rather than 22-24 days.

For the last release, I accidentally typed the release notes incorrectly (all instances of `1.1B` should have been `1.1A`) unfortunately, I can't go back and correct this, as it would make a duplicate release.

This is the final set of releases with new daily content. Content will still be added here, just not as often. Continued updates will be in yearly repositories. To continue, go to: [`https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_GitHub_Y2022`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_GitHub_Y2022)
